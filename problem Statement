PROBLEM STATEMENT :

Navigating local city transportation can be a challenging task for residents and visitors alike, especially in bustling urban areas.
Often, individuals are unsure which city bus to take to reach their destination, leading to confusion and the potential to choose more expensive alternatives such as auto-rickshaws. 
This situation results in increased transportation costs and unnecessary stress for commuters.

To address this issue, our project aims to simplify city bus transportation by providing an easy-to-use mobile application that leverages real-time user location data.
By taking user location permission and allowing users to input their source and destination points, the app can display the most suitable city bus routes available.
This ensures that users are informed about the best possible bus options, reducing the likelihood of overpaying for other modes of transport.

Additionally, the application incorporates a Room database to store the history of searched bus routes, enabling users to quickly access their previous searches.
This feature enhances the user experience by providing a personalized and efficient way to navigate city transportation.
